# XJSync
 Folder Synchonisation

To compile I'm using JBuilder. 

For the Mac, I have created a starter, but I forgot how this was done (it was more than 20 years ago)

For building the windows starter there is an IDE-file for Borland C++ and a solution for Visual Studio.

For the Linux-starter there is bash-script.
